    <p id="content">My name is Coder, I play Roblox I was born from ROblox and born in August 1, 2020 during the pandemic, On August 2, 2020, I started playing a game called Aiplane, next I played Airplane 2, so what I played was the games from creator of the Airplane and I also play Jailbreak, but later I stopped playing, On November 2020, I played Daycare 1 and Daycare 2 who it was made by Parwaz Studios, On November 28,2020 I got a Good Ending of Daycare 2 for the first time, Then I was so happy. On December 2020, I heard Airplane 4:One Last Flight it's coming on December 18,2020. On that day, The creator of Aiplane was revealed, His name is Ponchokings. I started now becoming a fan in January 2021, I have found a friend named Jayemmm111637, who plays Piggy, I started playing on February 2021. Later that I passed all maps of Books 1 and 2 before the day of Docks.It was released on June 26,2021(the day after Platform Madness came), Before when Platform Madness came, There was a game called StarBlox which released on April 9,2021. After months later, Piggy Chapter 12 was coming October 2021, which is the final chapter of Piggy. After the Chapter 12 was out, MiniToon wanted to released Chapter 12 True Ending on October 30th, but was postponed due to the Roblox cirumstances, MiniToon released it on the November 7, but no one got it yet because it was complicated, after few days, MinToon revealed the code on November 13,2021. After Piggy Ended, Ponchokings announced a New Game coming on November 27,2021 which was during break of Thanksgiving called Pet (Story).</p>
